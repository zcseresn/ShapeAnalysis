# ShapeAnalysis
Fiji plugin for DFT based shape factor calculation
This is the Python code to perform automated rotation of VRML surfaces (.wrl files).
The code runs inside Blender 2.75a as a script.
Also inluded here is a Blender file with the Python script already embedded.
This work is available as a paper in Cytometry A 2017, by Kriegel et al.  

The files named SHADExxx are part of the Fiji plugin that calculates the DFTs. For unaltered use, simply copy the jar file
into the "plugins" folder of your local Fiji installation. The .java file contains the source code, the .class file is its 
binary complied version.

Both for unaltered and altered use, please quote our work. Details are to be found in the header of each source code file.
